        <h3>ACT I. Algernon Moncrieff’s Flat in Half-Moon Street, W.</h3>

        <p style="white-space: pre">
        <p class="stage_directions">SCENE.--_Morning-room in Algernon’s flat in Half-Moon Street. The room is
            luxuriously and artistically furnished. The sound of a piano is heard
            in the adjoining room._  </p>
        <p class="stage_directions hover">(_Enter Lane._)</p>

        <h5 class="algernon">ALGERNON.</h5>
        <p>Bring me that cigarette case Mr. Worthing left in the smoking-room the
        last time he dined here.</p>

        <h5 class="lane"> LANE.</h5>
        <p>Yes, sir.</p><p class="stage_directions hover">(_Lane goes out._)</p>

        <h5 class="name jack">JACK.</h5>
        <P>Do you mean to say you have had my cigarette case all this time? I wish
        to goodness you had let me know. I have been writing frantic letters to
        Scotland Yard about it. I was very nearly offering a large reward.</P>

        <h5 class="algernon">ALGERNON.</h5>
        <p>Well, I wish you would offer one. I happen to be more than usually hard
        up.</p>

        <h5 class="name jack">JACK.</h5>
        <p>There is no good offering a large reward now that the thing is found.</p>

        <p class="stage_directions hover"> (_Enter Lane with the cigarette case on a salver. Algernon takes it at
        once. Lane goes out._)</p>

        <h5 class="algernon">ALGERNON.</h5>
        <p>I think that is rather mean of you, Ernest, I must say. </p><p class="stage_directions hover">(_Opens case and
        examines it._) <p>However, it makes no matter, for, now that I look at the
        inscription inside, I find that the thing isn’t yours after all.</p>

        <h5 class="name jack">JACK.</h5>
        <p>Of course it’s mine. [Moving to him.] You have seen me with it a
        hundred times, and you have no right whatsoever to read what is written
        inside. It is a very ungentlemanly thing to read a private cigarette
        case.</p>
