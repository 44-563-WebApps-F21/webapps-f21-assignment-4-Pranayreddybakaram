        <h3>ACT I. Algernon Moncrieff’s Flat in Half-Moon Street, W.</h3>

        <p style="white-space: pre">
        <p class="stage_directions">SCENE.--_Morning-room in Algernon’s flat in Half-Moon Street. The room is
            luxuriously and artistically furnished. The sound of a piano is heard
            in the adjoining room._ 
        </p>
        <p class="stage_directions hover">(_Lane is arranging afternoon tea on the table, and after the music has
            ceased, Algernon enters._)</p>      

        <p>
        <h6 class="name jack">JACK.</h6>
        <p class="speech"> I am in love with Gwendolen. I have come up to town expressly to
        propose to her.</p>

        <h5 class="algernon">ALGERNON.</h5>
        <p>I thought you had come up for pleasure? . . . I call that business.</p>

        <h5 class="name jack">JACK.</h5>
        <p>How utterly unromantic you are!</p>

        <h5 class="algernon">ALGERNON.</h5>
        <p>I really don’t see anything romantic in proposing. It is very romantic
        to be in love. But there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal.
        Why, one may be accepted. One usually is, I believe. Then the
        excitement is all over. The very essence of romance is uncertainty. If
        ever I get married, I’ll certainly try to forget the fact.</p>

        <h5 class="name jack">JACK.</h5>
        <p>I have no doubt about that, dear Algy. The Divorce Court was specially
        invented for people whose memories are so curiously constituted.</p>

        <h5 class="algernon">ALGERNON.</h5>
        <p>Oh! there is no use speculating on that subject. Divorces are made in
        Heaven—</p><p class="stage_directions hover">(_Jack puts out his hand to take a sandwich. Algernon at once
        interferes._)</p><p>Please don’t touch the cucumber sandwiches. They are
        ordered specially for Aunt Augusta.</p> <p class="stage_directions hover">(_one and eats it._)</p>

        <h5 class="name jack">JACK.</h5>
        <p>Well, you have been eating them all the time.</p>

        <h5 class="algernon">ALGERNON.</h5>
        <p>That is quite a different matter. She is my aunt.</p><p class="stage_directions hover"> (_Takes plate from
        below._)</p> <p>Have some bread and butter. The bread and butter is for
        Gwendolen. Gwendolen is devoted to bread and butter.</p>

        <h5 class="name jack">JACK.</h5>
        <p class="stage_directions hover">(_Advancing to table and helping himself._)</p><p> And very good bread and
        butter it is too.</p>

        <h5 class="algernon">ALGERNON.</h5>
        <p>Well, my dear fellow, you need not eat as if you were going to eat it
        all. You behave as if you were married to her already. You are not
        married to her already, and I don’t think you ever will be.</p>

        <h5 class="name jack">JACK.</h5>
        <p>Why on earth do you say that?</p>

        <h5 class="algernon">ALGERNON.</h5>
        <p>Well, in the first place girls never marry the men they flirt with.
        Girls don’t think it right.</p>

        <h5 class="name jack">JACK.</h5>
        <p>Oh, that is nonsense!</p>

        <h5 class="algernon">ALGERNON.</h5>
        <p>It isn’t. It is a great truth. It accounts for the extraordinary number
        of bachelors that one sees all over the place. In the second place, I
        don’t give my consent.</p>

        <h5 class="name jack">JACK.</h5>
        <p>Your consent!</p>

        <h5 class="algernon">ALGERNON.</h5>
        <p>My dear fellow, Gwendolen is my first cousin. And before I allow you to
        marry her, you will have to clear up the whole question of Cecily.</p>
        <p class="stage_directions hover">(_Rings bell._)</p>

        <h5 class="name jack">JACK.</h5>
        <p>Cecily! What on earth do you mean? What do you mean, Algy, by Cecily! I
        don’t know any one of the name of Cecily.</p>
